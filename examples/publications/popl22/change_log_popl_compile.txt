7/6/21

Here's the list of (slight) changes to get the popl version of these programs to compile on ~7/6/21. We should soon be able to undo these changes after a bit more bug-fixing on the backend. 

1. inline events 

// event add = add_to_firewall([client_ip; server_ip]);
generate Event.sslocate(add_to_firewall([client_ip; server_ip]), head);

2. remove all uses of the special-named event "this"

3. add "const int self = 0;" to all programs that use self

4. for now, expressions in a match can only be variables. In CountMinSketchTimeout.dpt I changed a few lines like this: 
    match (Array.get(cms#CMST_active, 0)) with
    -->
    auto tmp = Array.get(cms#CMST_active, 0);
    match (tmp) with

5. I didn't add support for negation yet, so things like this: 
  if (!in_filter)  { 
  --> 
  if (in_filter == false) {


6. args and orig args are some sort of tuple. The backend has no idea how to deal with comparing these things. So I changed: 
      if(args == orig_args) {
        retry_count = retry_count + 1;
      }
      --> 
      bool all_eq = true;
      for (i < 'k) {
        all_eq = all_eq && (args[i] == orig_args[i]);
      }
      if (all_eq) {
        retry_count = retry_count + 1;        
      }
