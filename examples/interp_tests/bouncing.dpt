/*
packetin and continue are special builtin events that let
a DPT program interface with an underlying P4 program.
-- packetin is an event that a P4 program can generate
from a single point in its control flow. From the P4 program's
point of view, the event handler gets executed immediately,
just like a function call would. There are no queues or recirculation
for packetin events.
-- continue is an event that allows a DPT handler to emit a packet
back to P4, from the exact point in the P4 code where packetin is called.
The arguments of a continue event are the same as the arguments to a
packetin event. Like packetin events, there are no queues or packet
recirculations for continue events.

Down the line, we want to generalize this so that the P4 program
can call other types of events as well (for example, a packetin event
that is specific to a TCP packet and has extra arguments)
