(* This is a tofino-specific normalization pass that ensures all array operations 
   use addresses in a tofino-compatible way. The requirements are: 
   1. array operations placed in the same table must all access the array with the same address
   2. for array operations placed in different tables, the match condition of each table 
      must be exact (no wildcards).

  This module contains 2 passes that ensure these requirements are met:
    Pass 1 (in TofinoCore IR, before layout or conversion to graph form): 
            if any path constraint is not exact-match compatible, 
            add address variable and transform into single-access address form
    Pass 2 (in graph form, right before layout):
      1. make sure all statements that touch an array that is accessed by statements with multiple addresses are exact
      2. (after graph form)  remove all negation rules -- since they're exact, it doesn't matter
      3. (after graph form)  make nodes solitary

  Then, in the layout algorithm, the following should happen without any modifications:
    - for each statement group that accesses an array: 
      - if they have multiple addresses, each statement will be 
          1. exact
          2. solitary
        So each statement will be exact, meaning it can be implemented by an exact table. 
        And also, since each statment is solitary, we know that there will be no cross-product 
        effect that creates a need for a wildcard rule.
      - if they don't have multiple addresses, then it doesn't matter as they can be placed wherever
