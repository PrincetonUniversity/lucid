(* What???
  Single assignment form adds a bunch of variables to the backend.
  This puts pressure on the PHV layout stage of the tofino backend.
  It is amplified because we don't do general register allocation
  to reduce the number of local variables.
  Ultimately, single assignment form causes some programs to fail,
  for the current Lucid compiler.
  As a temporary workaround, this module puts certain parts
  of a program into single assignment form, so that the
  layout stage doesn't generate semantically incorrect programs.
