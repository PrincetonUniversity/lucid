### TODO:


1. think about how to express the three components of a system: 
  1. packet pre-processor (history collection, load-balancing measurement)
  2. scheduler (decide which core to put a packet onto)
  3. core processing (process the packet and history)
  
2. things that lucid needs:

  - more complex memops, or more flexible ordering system
    + unrestricted memops?
  - iteration primitives
