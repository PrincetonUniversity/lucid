# Tutorials

There are two [tutorials in the repository](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/lucid/tree/main/tutorials). Each tutorial has a short series of well-documented examples that demonstrates and explains the core parts of Lucid. If you have not yet installed Lucid, [...]

- [interp](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/lucid/tree/main/tutorials/interp/readme.md) : Developing Lucid applications with the interpreter.

- [tofino](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/lucid/tree/main/tutorials/tofino/readme.md): Compiling and running Lucid applications to the Tofino.

After going through these tutorials, you should be ready to dig into the example and test applications:

- The suite of [interpreter test programs](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/lucid/tree/main/examples/interp_tests)

- Some re-usable [data structure libraries](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/lucid/tree/main/examples/library)

- A few [larger example applications](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/lucid/tree/main/examples).

To see how to do specific things, look at the comprehensive details about all of Lucid's features in the [wiki](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/lucid/wiki).
